A monorepo with all of my weather-related projects in it. Notably, the [NWS bots](#bots) are located here.

# products

## [warnings](https://pkg.go.dev/git.sr.ht/~jordanreger/wx/products/warnings)

A library for accessing NWS warnings (of any type).

# bots

These bots are almost identical mirrors of the Twitter NWS Tornado, Severe Tstorm and Flash Flood bots. However, they do not interact with the Twitter bots in any manner; they get their data from the source (the NWS API). Because of this, there are slight differences in the functionality. They also don't generate images of the warning polygons because text, although it may be limiting, can be shared faster and easier.
